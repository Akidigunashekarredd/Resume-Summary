The Data Lake program is started to provide multi-talent, secure data hub to store application's data on Hadoop platform with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The object of the project is to provide necessary engineering support to analytics and application teams so that they can focus on the business logic development. In this project, the major task is to set up the Hadoop cluster and govern all the activities which are required for the smooth functioning of various Hadoop ecosystems. As the day and day data increasing so to provide stability to the ecosystem and smooth working of it, Developing and automating the various requirement specific utilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nResponsibility 1. Developed proactive Health Check utility for Data Lake. The utility proactively checks the smooth functioning of all Hadoop components on the cluster and sends the result to email in HTML format. The utility is being used for daily Health Checks as well as after upgrades.\\r\\n2. Getting the data in different formats and processing the data in Hadoop ecosystem after filtering the data using the appropriate techniques.\\r\\n3. Developed data pipeline utility to ingest data from RDBMS database to Hive external tables using Sqoop commands. The utility also offers the data quality check like row count validation.\\r\\n4. Developed and automated various cluster health check, usage, capacity related reports using Unix shell scripting.\\r\\n5. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.\\r\\n6. Creating flume agents to process the data to Hadoop ecosystem side.\\r\\n7.

Due to RDBMS limitations to process waste amount of data at once and produce the results at the earliest, Client wanted to move the data to Hadoop ecosystem so that they can over-come from those limitations and focus on business improvement only.\\r\\n\\r\\nResponsibility 1. Optimising the SQL queries for those data which were not required to move from RDBMS to any other platform.\\r\\n2. Writing the Hive queries and logic to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop ecosystem.\\r\\n3. Writing the hive queries to analyse the required data as per the business requirements.\\r\\n4. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.\\r\\n5. Writing the sqoop commands and scripts to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop side.\\r\\ncompany - Tata Consultancy Services\\r\\ndescription - Project Description\\r\\nCreate recs and migrating static setup of reconciliations from 8.1 version to 9.1 version of the environment Intellimatch.\\r\\n\\r\\nResponsibility 1.
